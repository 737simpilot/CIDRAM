CIDRAM (Classless Inter-Domain Routing Access Manager) Changelog.

=== VERSIONING GUIDELINES ===
CIDRAM adheres to the SemVer guidelines for versioning.

Versioning guidelines for SemVer can be found at: http://www.semver.org/

=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2017.02.06; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the CIDRAM
  README documentation into Arabic (fuzzy and poor quality though). This totals
  14 different language versions of the README documentation now available.

- [2017.02.06; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the CIDRAM
  README documentation into Korean (fuzzy). This totals 15 different language
  versions of the README documentation now available.

- [2017.02.07; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved template
  files; Replaced all existing doctype declarations with the doctype
  declaration recommended for HTML5, and slightly improved HTML5 compliance.
  Added an extra safeguard against bad IPv6 factoring.

- [2017.02.11; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved future compatibility
  with PHP => 8 ("each" function has been identified as targetted for
  deprecation as of PHP 7.2.0).
  Refer wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_7_2

- [2017.02.12-13; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Some subtle refactoring.

- [2017.02.17; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Whitelisting IPs/CIDRs via IPv4/IPv6
  signature files wasn't resulting in those IPs/CIDRs being whitelisted against
  being blocked by module files; Fixed.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=4076

- [2017.02.17; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly relaxed some of the
  restrictions enforced for which filenames can be worked with via the
  front-end. Added a "hotfix" to automatically detect and update the plugin
  version cited in the plugins dashboard for when CIDRAM is running as a
  WordPress plugin.

- [2017.02.19; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Front-end documentation added.

=== Version/Release 0.7.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2016.12.15; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Files containing underscores weren't
  deleting when uninstalling components; Fixed.

- [2016.12.20; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added support for simple CSV signature
  files (integrated directly into the already existing functionality for
  processing signature files; CIDRAM should be able to automatically detect
  whether a signature file uses the normal, default format, or CSV format).
  Additionally, added support for using single IPs in signature files directly,
  without the need for them to use complete CIDR notation (IPs that don't
  include a range will be interpreted seamlessly as 32's for in the case of
  IPv4 signature files and as 128's for in the case of IPv6 signature files).

- [2016.12.31; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added support for optionally including
  additional modules into CIDRAM to run after checking IPv4/IPv6 signatures.

- [2017.01.02; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to track and to
  temporarily ban IP addresses blocked by modules.

- [2017.01.05; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Fixed a bug related to the dislay of
  reCAPTCHA instances which could arise in some specific situations when some
  specific configurations are used in combination with specially marked
  sections.

- [2017.01.05; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added a new directive to control
  the maximum number of infractions an IP is allowed to incur before it is
  banned by IP tracking ("infraction_limit"). Improved the readability of the
  front-end configuration page by including directive names alongside their
  descriptions and formatting accordingly. Rewrote the "Direct" closure in the
  loader (nothing was broken, changed functionality, and patching not required;
  just changed due to that a code quality checking tool I sometimes use was
  complaining about the way it was written before).

- [2017.01.10; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added several new directives:
  "ban_override", which allows overriding the value for "forbid_on_block" when
  requests from banned IPs are blocked, and allows skipping processing for the
  template files when processing blocked requests from banned IPs;
  "log_banned_ips", which allows specifying whether to include blocked requests
  from banned IPs in the logfiles; and "track_mode", which allows specifying
  whether to only track IPs blocked by modules, or to track IPs blocked for any
  reasons (eg, via the standard signature files as well as via the modules).

- [2017.01.12; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to distinguish
  between bots masquerading as popular search engines (eg, Googlebot, Bingbot,
  Yahoo! Slurp) and their real, legitimate counterparts. From herein, these
  fake search engine bots will be blocked by default upon detection, whereas
  their legitimate counterparts will have IP tracking disabled by default upon
  detection, therefore rendering them unbannable. Added the ability to perform
  timed DNS lookups, both forward and reverse, along with the ability to cache
  the results of these lookups. Added a new directive: "default_dns".

- [2017.01.15; Bug-fixes; Maikuolan]: Bug found whereby false positives against
  search engines could occasionally be generated as a result of failed and
  incorrect DNS lookups (possible since the 2017.01.12 update); Code therefore
  modified as such to prevent this from occurring; Timeout limit increased and
  timed out lookups now result in no action being taken. Bug found whereby
  logging banned IPs which had exceeded the infraction limit could result in no
  log entry ID being parsed into log entries; Fixed.

- [2017.01.23; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: "default_dns" can now be a
  comma delimited list, allowing fallback servers to be used for DNS lookups.

- [2017.01.24; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Further split the signature files, to
  keep signatures for cloud services, signatures for dangerous and spammy ISPs,
  and other signatures separate from each other, and to further improve
  modularisation.

- [2017.01.25; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved component ordering
  mechanism for the updates page.

- [2017.01.26; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added a CIDR calculator to the
  front-end.

- [2017.01.27; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: When used, "ban_override" would trigger any
  time any block occurred, instead of only when the infraction limit had been
  exceeded; Fixed.

- [2017.01.29; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Some versions of the DAT files used by the
  front-end updater for updating various components, signature files, modules,
  blocklists, etc, would sometimes glitch out and save several dozen duplicates
  of the same component entries when newly released components were detected as
  available for download, when those DAT files contained terminating markers at
  unexpected points in the file, when they contained too many terminating
  markers, and/or when they contained inappropriate formatting; Fixed.

- [2017.01.30; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the CIDRAM
  README documentation into Japanese (fuzzy). This totals 13 different language
  versions of the README documentation now available.

- [2017.01.31; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added a new directive to control
  whether the protections normally provided by CIDRAM are applied to the
  front-end ("protect_frontend"). Possibly useful in cases where users may be
  at risk of blocking themselves due to experimenting with new signatures, new
  modules, etc.

=== Version/Release 0.6.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.11.29; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Some notices occasionally generated to the
  error logs by undefined indexes when accessing the updater; Fixed.

- [2016.12.02; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added some polyfills to
  extend compatibility with CIDRAM to PHP 5.4.x (the newly introduced front-end
  feature for CIDRAM makes use of the password_hash and password_verify
  functions, of which are only available natively to PHP versions 5.5.0 and
  above).

- [2016.12.03; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved mechanism for making
  determinations between requests via direct access and requests via hooks.

- [2016.12.05; Bug-fixes; Maikuolan]: Bug found whereby incorrect filenames
  would sometimes be reported by the updater for the optional country-wide
  blocklists; Fixed. Bug found whereby the active/inactive status for signature
  files would sometimes be incorrectly reported by the updater; Fixed.

- [2016.12.06; Bug-fixes; Maikuolan]: Bug found whereby the install option
  would sometimes not be displayed for some components; Fixed. Bug found
  whereby cells would sometimes be incorrectly rendered for newly discovered
  components; Fixed.

- [2016.12.08; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved mechanism for
  accessing logfiles via the front-end.

- [2016.12.11; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Removed "matchElement" (never
  used; redundant; better to use "in_array" instead anyway). Improved some of
  the docBlock comments. Did some subtle refactoring. Slightly tweaked some of
  the front-end aesthetics.

- [2016.12.12; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the CIDRAM
  README documentation into German (fuzzy and quite likely erroneous, though).
  This totals 12 different language versions of the README documentation now
  available.

Caleb M / Maikuolan,
12th December 2016.

=== Version/Release 0.6.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2016.10.18; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Created a "configuration handler"
  file so as to move everything away from the loader (this'll be important for
  being able to self-update in the future). Slightly improved the YAML closure.
  Fallbacks no longer hardcoded with PHP at the time of loading the
  configuration file; Fallbacks now determined via a separate configuration
  defaults file written using YAML.

- [2016.11.03; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Split signature files, to keep the bogon
  signatures to their own separate signature files (this may help to improve
  performance for any users that don't want to block bogons).

- [2016.11.05; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the CIDRAM
  README documentation into Russian (fuzzy and quite likely erroneous, though).
  This totals 11 different language versions of the README documentation now
  available.

- [2016.11.28; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Finished building the CIDRAM front-end!
  Using the CIDRAM front-end, you can update CIDRAM directly from your browser,
  install and update components and custom signature files, including the
  optional country-wide blocklists provided by MacMathan, language packs and
  more; You can modify core CIDRAM files, upload new files to your vault, view
  and download logfiles, and via the accounts page, selectively grant access to
  others either to administrate CIDRAM on your behalf, or to a more limited
  degree, to access the CIDRAM logfiles directly from the browser; You can test
  batches of IP addresses directly from your browser, to confirm whether
  they're blocked by whichever signature files you have installed at any given
  time; And you can update the CIDRAM configuration directly from your browser,
  too. Front-end access is disabled by default for security reasons, but you
  can enable it via the relevant newly created configuration directives
  pertaining to it.

=== Version/Release 0.5.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

No notable changes to the CIDRAM codebase have been made since the previously
released version. This patch release exists due to numerous significant changes
that've been made to the signature files of CIDRAM since the previously
released version. Updating the working code of CIDRAM from the previously
released version to this version release is not necessary, but updating all
signature files is strongly recommended.

In addition, it is strongly recommended for users updating to this release from
the previous release, to carefully review the changes made to the "ignore.dat"
file prior to doing so; There are some new instructions included in the
"ignore.dat" as of this release which correspond mostly to some new signature
sections introduced into the signature files as of this release, which may or
may not be desired by users, depending on the needs of and the demographics
targeted by the user (updating the signature files, and/or updating to this
release from the previous release, without first reviewing the changes made to
the "ignore.dat" file, may potentially risk an increase in the number of false
positives encountered by the user).

Caleb M / Maikuolan,
1st October 2016.

=== Version/Release 0.5.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2016.08.11; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Revisited the changes made as
  of the previous versioned release (0.4.1) regarding the slightly improved RTL
  text support (there were some rendering problems for some languages caused by
  the approach taken; this has been corrected).

- [2016.08.11; Non-core change (Wordpress plugin); Maikuolan]: Added code to
  ensure that CIDRAM will be loaded before any other plugins in order to help
  avoid conflicts associated with caching plugins and other caching systems
  which could sometimes prevent requests from being blocked.

- [2016.08.14; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added reCAPTCHA support to CIDRAM! It's
  now (optionally) possible to allow users to bypass the normal "Access Denied"
  page by submitting a reCAPTCHA form. This should help mitigate some of the
  risks associated with blocking any CIDRs that may potentially carry human
  users/traffic. Due to some of the functionality required by this feature, the
  minimum version of PHP required in order to execute CIDRAM has been raised
  from "5.3.0" to "5.5.0" (that said though, "5.5.0" itself reached official
  "End of Life" status 24 days ago, so it would extremely advisable for users
  to not be using any versions of PHP older than that version anyhow).
  Additionally, this feature has resulted in the creation of some new
  configuration directives and some new files added to the vault (but the
  changes are entirely backwards-compatible).

- [2016.08.17; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved SoC for the reCAPTCHA
  feature (split into its own file and improved modularisation); Added code to
  allow certain specific HTML tags within the block information (requested by
  some users; these would've previously been broken by the anti-XSS
  sanitisation); Added some additional configuration options for the reCAPTCHA
  feature.

- [2016.08.18; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Adjusted auto-typecasting
  closure (change required to accommodate some of the newer configuration
  directives); Salts made to be optional; Some subtle refactoring; Added
  support for user-free bypasses.

Caleb M / Maikuolan,
24th August 2016.

=== Version/Release 0.4.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.08.03; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added internal language
  support for Korean (15 language options now supported in total, not including
  CLI-mode support; Done with machine assistance, I'm not fluent, and it hasn't
  yet been audited, so, the new translation should be regarded as fuzzy).

- [2016.08.06; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved RTL text
  support; Adjusted the template file to compensate for display problems
  associated LTR/RTL mixed content.

- [2016.08.06; Documentation; Maikuolan]: More work done on the documentation
  translations; Slightly closer to completing the translations for all targeted
  languages.

- [2016.08.06; Non-core change (Wordpress plugin); Maikuolan]: Opted to remove
  action hook call and instead load everything immediately, as to avoid
  conflicts associated with caching plugins and other caching systems which
  could sometimes prevent requests from being blocked.

- [2016.08.07; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Slightly improved/optimised
  the template file.

Caleb M / Maikuolan,
7th August 2016.

=== Version/Release 0.4.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2016.07.22; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added code to perform some
  simple sanitisation to the block information; This should help to prevent
  some obscure types of XSS attacks.

- [2016.07.23; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added internal language support
  for Japanese (14 language options now supported in total, not including
  CLI-mode support; I'm not fluent and it hasn't yet been audited, so, the new
  translation should be regarded as fuzzy). Added a new function: "Greylist";
  This can be used in the same way that whitelisting is used, but for escaping
  a CIDR from a single file, rather than from all files. Slightly improved the
  signature validator/fixer (can now detect broken/invalid ranges).

- [2016.07.26; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added some basic support for YAML-like
  data (note: not a true YAML implementation) to be read from signature files,
  which can used to specify and modify the values of configuration directives
  for separate signature sections.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/6

- [2016.07.30; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Fixed a bug whereby some configuration
  directives (in particular, "forbid_on_block") would sometimes be incorrectly
  typecasted, resulting in unexpected behaviour contrary to the documentation.

Caleb M / Maikuolan,
31st July 2016.

=== Version/Release 0.3.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.06.18; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: A bug was found by joe38 whereby some of
  the provider-specific bypasses included in the default CIDRAM signatures
  would trigger an error instead of the expected CIDRAM Access Denied message,
  and additionally, some bypasses weren't written with the considerations
  appropriate to the execution context required from which they were executing;
  Fixed. Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=3905

- [2016.07.04; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the CIDRAM
  README documentation into Vietnamese. This totals 10 different language
  versions of the README documentation now available.

Caleb M / Maikuolan,
9th July 2016.

=== Version/Release 0.3.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2016.04.25; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Signature files can now be
  specified via the configuration file (and so, modifying core script files in
  order to add additional custom signature files is no longer required).

- [2016.04.27; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: An additional custom rules
  file added for additional bypasses.

- [2016.05.12; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added internal language
  support for Vietnamese (now supported: English, Spanish, French, Indonesian,
  Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Chinese [simplified and
  traditional]; 10 language options now supported in total).

- [2016.05.13; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added internal language
  support for German (11 language options now supported in total).

- [2016.05.13; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan/m7mdtiger]: Added internal
  language support for Arabic (12 language options now supported in total).

- [2016.05.26; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added a new i18n shorthand value
  for "Deny": "Proxy" (for blocking private and anonymous proxies).

- [2016.05.27; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to use dated
  logfiles! Now, some simple variables ({dd}, {mm}, {yyyy}/{yy}, {hh}) can be
  included when specifying the names to use for logfiles in order to organise
  logfiles by date/time. Added a new directive ("timeOffset") to account for
  the possibility of discrepancies between servers and the local time of those
  using CIDRAM.

- [2016.06.13; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to ignore
  signature sections by identifying their section tags to an ignore file.
  Refactored a number of closures to reduce code duplication and to improve the
  their process logic; Some old closures renamed and split into multiple new
  closures. Added internal language support for Russian (13 language options
  now supported in total, not including CLI-mode support).

Caleb M / Maikuolan,
14th June 2016.

=== Version/Release 0.2.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2016.03.15; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Added Microsoft Azure CIDRs to the IPv4
  signatures file; Updating several sections; Changed the "example" CIDRs in
  the IPv4 custom signatures file to reduce ambiguity (because the previous
  examples used CIDRs that wouldn't normally be triggered; fixed).

- [2016.03.17; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Removed all references to HostExploit
  and SiteVet from CIDRAM. These two services appear to have not been updated
  in over a year and a half, and emails I've sent to them to ask whether their
  services are actively maintained and/or up-to-date seem to have been ignored,
  as I've not received any replies from them for any of the emails I'd sent. I
  don't think we should rely on outdated information. I've opted, instead, to
  include references to and information about the Google Malware Dashboard,
  which appears to be being updated on a daily basis, have a greater depth of
  information available and appears to be more reliable, so far. I've already
  added some new sections for new ASNs to block based upon the information they
  have available, and may possibly remove and/or modify some old sections in
  the future based on the information they have available.

- [2016.03.18; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Renamed all "INC" files to "PHP"
  files and changed all references to them accordingly.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.03.19; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Changed the default value of
  the "block_bogons" directive from true to false. Added a new directive,
  "disable_cli", to optionally disable the CLI mode implementation for CIDRAM.
  Added a fallback to help deal with situations where multiple IP address
  server variables may be in use.

- [2016.03.21; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Improved the way in which we can detect
  whether we're in CLI-mode (there was a problem previously whereby cronjobs
  could sometimes be blocked in certain circumstances, and this shouldn't
  happen normally, thus qualifying this problem as a bug; this improvement
  corrects this problem).
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/4

- [2016.03.25; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Removed references to the
  "package" tag from all phpDoc page blocks in the package (we don't need
  these, because we already have README documentation and don't use api-docs).
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/85

- [2016.03.27; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added a "Why Blocked" field for
  the "Access Denied" page and for logging, to act as a debug mechanism to help
  track line/offset/section values for triggered signatures. Added code to
  allow CIDRAM to handle Windows-style linebreaks within the signature files,
  as so that it can now correctly interpret more than just Unix-style
  linebreaks.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=3819
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.03.28; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added support for section tags!
  It's now possible to uniquely identify specific signature sections from the
  signature files by tagging sections with a section tag; These section tags
  will be included in the logfiles whenever any of the signatures from the
  tagged sections are triggered and will appear alongside debug information
  for the user whenever they're blocked.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=3819
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.03.31; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Renamed "ipv4_custom.dat" to
  "ipv4_custom.dat.RenameMe" and renamed "ipv6_custom.dat" to
  "ipv6_custom.dat.RenameMe". The reason for appending ".RenameMe" onto the end
  of the names of the custom signature files is to prevent accidentally
  overwriting these files whenever someone updates CIDRAM blindly (such as via
  a dependency manager, installer or auto-updater; The custom signature files
  should be renamed back to their original former names by the user to activate
  them). Shell-style hashing implemented to all signature files for all
  comments and for all non-signature and non-syntactical entries; This won't
  be enforced onto users, but is recommended to improve readability for IDEs
  and text editors. Added some information from Spamhaus to help users gage the
  merit of blocking or not blocking some particular ASNs. Numerous new
  signature sections added to both the IPv4 and IPv6 signature files.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=3819
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.04.01; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Renamed "config.ini" to
  "config.ini.RenameMe". The reason here is the same as the reason for having
  recently done the same thing to the custom signature files (to prevent
  accidentally overwriting this file whenever someone updates CIDRAM blindly).
  Additionally, the configuration file is now optional; The script has
  fallbacks implemented for all configuration directives and no longer dies an
  error to the user/client when the configuration file is unavailable. Added a
  "Reconstructed URL" field for the "Access Denied" page and for logging, to
  determine which resource was being requested at the time of a user/client
  being blocked.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=3819
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.04.02; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: A bug was found by GaffNet whereby custom
  whitelist signatures were ignored by the script as of the latest version of
  the codebase due to the way that whitelist signatures were handled; This has
  been fixed.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/7

- [2016.04.03; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added support for Apache-style
  logging and for serialised logging (this could help any users wanting to
  integrate CIDRAM with packages such as fail2ban, which require Apache-style
  logs), and two related new configuration directives. Extended the
  "forbid_on_block" directive to allow 503 header responses. Added the ability
  to silently redirect blocked access attempts instead of displaying the usual
  "Access Denied" page. Did some more minor code refactoring.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=3819
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.04.04; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added support for custom themes;
  A new directive has been added to the configuration file allowing users to
  stipulate a custom CSS file to apply to the HTML output template; This and
  the new custom themes support for CIDRAM will work in the exact same way that
  custom themes for phpMussel works. Implemented a validator/fixer for checking
  and fixing signature files; Currently a work-in-progress and a BETA, but
  seems to function correctly and as intended; Currently only available in CLI,
  but will be available via other means after work has been completed.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/9

- [2016.04.10; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added support for section expiry!
  It's now possible to mark signature sections with an expiry date, to ensure
  that any signatures they contain won't be triggered after a specified date.
  This feature is optional; Unmarked signature sections won't expire.

- [2016.04.10; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Added numerous new signature sections to
  the signature files, covering a number of different new ASNs. Added IPs from
  ZeuS C&C tracker.

- [2016.04.12; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Split the language data files
  into two dinstinct files per each language; Standard language data and CLI
  language data.

- [2016.04.17; Minor code change; divinity76]: Stricter loading for the
  configuration file (CIDRAM will now return an error if the configuration file
  isn't readable).

Caleb M / Maikuolan,
18th April 2016.

=== Version/Release 0.1.2 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.03.11; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: When converting all functions
  to closures (anonymous functions) for the previous release, I missed the
  "matchElement" function. I'd thought I'd got them all, but I'd missed this
  one (this function wasn't yet being used anywhere anyhow, so, missing it
  wouldn't have been particularly problematic, anyhow); In any case, this has
  now been corrected.

- [2016.03.13; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the CIDRAM
  README documentation into Chinese. This totals 9 different language versions
  of the README documentation now available.

- [2016.03.14; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: A bug was found within the IPv6Test closure
  function (used for calculating IPv6 CIDRs), caused by some excess spaces in
  the code that existed where they shouldn't have existed; Fixed.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/2

Caleb M / Maikuolan,
14th March 2016.

=== Version/Release 0.1.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.03.03-2016.03.06; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translations for
  the CIDRAM README documentation (written originally in English) into Spanish,
  French, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch (none of these translations
  have been checked/audited by a native/fluent speaker yet, but they should be
  at least accurate enough to be understood). This totals 7 different language
  versions of the README documentation now available.

- [2016.03.07; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Converted all functions to
  closures (anonymous functions), in order to be able to unset them from memory
  after the script execution has finished (we shouldn't leave unrequired data
  in the memory afer execution has finished). Changed the blocksize for reading
  files with the "ReadFile" function from 48KB to 128KB (we can afford this,
  and this should *slightly* increase the speed of the script).
