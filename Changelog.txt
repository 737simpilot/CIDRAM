=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2016.03.11; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: When converting all functions
  to closures (anonymous functions) for the previous release, I missed the
  "matchElement" function. I'd thought I'd got them all, but I'd missed this
  one (this function wasn't yet being used anywhere anyhow, so, missing it
  wouldn't have been particularly problematic, anyhow); In any case, this has
  now been corrected.

=== Version/Release 0.1.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.03.03-2016.03.06; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translations for
  the README documentation of CIDRAM (written originally in English) into
  Spanish, French, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch (none of these
  translations have been checked/audited by a native/fluent speaker yet, but
  they should be at least accurate enough to be understood). This totals 7
  different languages versions of the README document now available.

- [2016.03.07; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Converted all functions to
  closures (anonymous functions), in order to be able to unset them from memory
  after the script execution has finished (we shouldn't leave unrequired data
  in the memory afer execution has finished). Changed the blocksize for reading
  files with the "ReadFile" function from 48KB to 128KB (we can afford this,
  and this should *slightly* increase the speed of the script).
