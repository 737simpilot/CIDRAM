CIDRAM (Classless Inter-Domain Routing Access Manager) Changelog.

=== VERSIONING GUIDELINES ===
CIDRAM adheres to the SemVer guidelines for versioning.

Versioning guidelines for SemVer can be found at: http://www.semver.org/

=== Changes made since last versioned release ===

- [2016.07.22; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added code to perform some
  simple sanitisation to the block information; This should help to prevent
  some obscure types of XXS attacks.

- [2016.07.23; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added internal language support
  for Japanese (14 language options now supported in total, not including
  CLI-mode support; I'm not fluent and it hasn't yet been audited, so, the new
  translation should be regarded as fuzzy). Added a new function: "Greylist";
  This can be used in the same way taht whitelisting is used, but for escaping
  a CIDR from a single file, rather than from all files. Slightly improved the
  signature validator/fixer (can now detect broken/invalid ranges).

=== Version/Release 0.3.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.06.18; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: A bug was found by joe38 whereby some of
  the provider-specific bypasses included in the default CIDRAM signatures
  would trigger an error instead of the expected CIDRAM Access Denied message,
  and additionally, some bypasses weren't written with the considerations
  appropriate to the execution context required from which they were executing;
  Fixed. Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=3905

- [2016.07.04; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the CIDRAM
  README documentation into Vietnamese. This totals 10 different language
  versions of the README documentation now available.

=== Version/Release 0.3.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2016.04.25; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Signature files can now be
  specified via the configuration file (and so, modifying core script files in
  order to add additional custom signature files is no longer required).

- [2016.04.27; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: An additional custom rules
  file added for additional bypasses.

- [2016.05.12; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added internal language support
  for Vietnamese (now supported: English, Spanish, French, Indonesian,
  Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Chinese [simplified and
  traditional]; 10 language options now supported in total).

- [2016.05.13; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added internal language support
  for German (11 language options now supported in total).

- [2016.05.13; Minor code change; Maikuolan/m7mdtiger]: Added language support
  for Arabic (12 language options now supported in total).

- [2016.05.26; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added a new i18n shorthand value
  for "Deny": "Proxy" (for blocking private and anonymous proxies).

- [2016.05.27; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to use dated
  logfiles! Now, some simple variables ({dd}, {mm}, {yyyy}/{yy}, {hh}) can be
  included when specifying the names to use for logfiles in order to organise
  logfiles by date/time. Added a new directive ("timeOffset") to account for
  the possibility of discrepancies between servers and the local time of those
  using CIDRAM.

- [2016.06.13; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to ignore
  signature sections by identifying their section tags to an ignore file.
  Refactored a number of closures to reduce code duplication and to improve the
  their process logic; Some old closures renamed and split into multiple new
  closures. Added internal language support for Russian (13 language options
  now supported in total, not including CLI-mode support).

=== Version/Release 0.2.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2016.03.15; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Added Microsoft Azure CIDRs to the IPv4
  signatures file; Updating several sections; Changed the "example" CIDRs in
  the IPv4 custom signatures file to reduce ambiguity (because the previous
  examples used CIDRs that wouldn't normally be triggered; fixed).

- [2016.03.17; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Removed all references to HostExploit
  and SiteVet from CIDRAM. These two services appear to have not been updated
  in over a year and a half, and emails I've sent to them to ask whether their
  services are actively maintained and/or up-to-date seem to have been ignored,
  as I've not received any replies from them for any of the emails I'd sent. I
  don't think we should rely on outdated information. I've opted, instead, to
  include references to and information about the Google Malware Dashboard,
  which appears to be being updated on a daily basis, have a greater depth of
  information available and appears to be more reliable, so far. I've already
  added some new sections for new ASNs to block based upon the information they
  have available, and may possibly remove and/or modify some old sections in
  the future based on the information they have available.

- [2016.03.18; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Renamed all "INC" files to "PHP"
  files and changed all references to them accordingly.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.03.19; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Changed the default value of
  the "block_bogons" directive from true to false. Added a new directive,
  "disable_cli", to optionally disable the CLI mode implementation for CIDRAM.
  Added a fallback to help deal with situations where multiple IP address
  server variables may be in use.

- [2016.03.21; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Improved the way in which we can detect
  whether we're in CLI-mode (there was a problem previously whereby cronjobs
  could sometimes be blocked in certain circumstances, and this shouldn't
  happen normally, thus qualifying this problem as a bug; this improvement
  corrects this problem).
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/4

- [2016.03.25; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Removed references to the
  "package" tag from all phpDoc page blocks in the package (we don't need
  these, because we already have README documentation and don't use api-docs).
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues/85

- [2016.03.27; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added a "Why Blocked" field for
  the "Access Denied" page and for logging, to act as a debug mechanism to help
  track line/offset/section values for triggered signatures. Added code to
  allow CIDRAM to handle Windows-style linebreaks within the signature files,
  as so that it can now correctly interpret more than just Unix-style
  linebreaks.

  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.03.28; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added support for section tags!
  It's now possible to uniquely identify specific signature sections from the
  signature files by tagging sections with a section tag; These section tags
  will be included in the logfiles whenever any of the signatures from the
  tagged sections are triggered and will appear alongside debug information
  for the user whenever they're blocked.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=3819
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.03.31; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Renamed "ipv4_custom.dat" to
  "ipv4_custom.dat.RenameMe" and renamed "ipv6_custom.dat" to
  "ipv6_custom.dat.RenameMe". The reason for appending ".RenameMe" onto the end
  of the names of the custom signature files is to prevent accidentally
  overwriting these files whenever someone updates CIDRAM blindly (such as via
  a dependency manager, installer or auto-updater; The custom signature files
  should be renamed back to their original former names by the user to activate
  them). Shell-style hashing implemented to all signature files for all
  comments and for all non-signature and non-syntactical entries; This won't
  be enforced onto users, but is recommended to improve readability for IDEs
  and text editors. Added some information from Spamhaus to help users gage the
  merit of blocking or not blocking some particular ASNs. Numerous new
  signature sections added to both the IPv4 and IPv6 signature files.

  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.04.01; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Renamed "config.ini" to
  "config.ini.RenameMe". The reason here is the same as the reason for having
  recently done the same thing to the custom signature files (to prevent
  accidentally overwriting this file whenever someone updates CIDRAM blindly).
  Additionally, the configuration file is now optional; The script has
  fallbacks implemented for all configuration directives and no longer dies an
  error to the user/client when the configuration file is unavailable. Added a
  "Reconstructed URL" field for the "Access Denied" page and for logging, to
  determine which resource was being requested at the time of a user/client
  being blocked.

  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.04.02; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: A bug was found by GaffNet whereby custom
  whitelist signatures were ignored by the script as of the latest version of
  the codebase due to the way that whitelist signatures were handled; This has
  been fixed.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/7

- [2016.04.03; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added support for Apache-style
  logging and for serialised logging (this could help any users wanting to
  integrate CIDRAM with packages such as fail2ban, which require Apache-style
  logs), and two related new configuration directives. Extended the
  "forbid_on_block" directive to allow 503 header responses. Added the ability
  to silently redirect blocked access attempts instead of displaying the usual
  "Access Denied" page. Did some more minor code refactoring.
  Refer spambotsecurity.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=3819
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/3

- [2016.04.04; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added support for custom themes;
  A new directive has been added to the configuration file allowing users to
  stipulate a custom CSS file to apply to the HTML output template; This and
  the new custom themes support for CIDRAM will work in the exact same way that
  custom themes for phpMussel works. Implemented a validator/fixer for checking
  and fixing signature files; Currently a work-in-progress and a BETA, but
  seems to function correctly and as intended; Currently only available in CLI,
  but will be available via other means after work has been completed.
  Refer github.com/Maikuolan/CIDRAM/issues/9

- [2016.04.10; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added support for section expiry!
  It's now possible to mark signature sections with an expiry date, to ensure
  that any signatures they contain won't be triggered after a specified date.
  This feature is optional; Unmarked signature sections won't expire.

- [2016.04.10; Signatures; Maikuolan]: Added numerous new signature sections to
  the signature files, covering a number of different new ASNs. Added IPs from
  ZeuS C&C tracker.

- [2016.04.12; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Split the language data files
  into two dinstinct files per each language; Standard language data and CLI
  language data.

- [2016.04.17; Minor code change; divinity76]: Stricter loading for the
  configuration file (CIDRAM will now return an error if the configuration file
  isn't readable).

=== Version/Release 0.1.2 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.03.11; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: When converting all functions
  to closures (anonymous functions) for the previous release, I missed the
  "matchElement" function. I'd thought I'd got them all, but I'd missed this
  one (this function wasn't yet being used anywhere anyhow, so, missing it
  wouldn't have been particularly problematic, anyhow); In any case, this has
  now been corrected.

- [2016.03.13; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the CIDRAM
  README documentation into Chinese. This totals 9 different language versions
  of the README documentation now available.

- [2016.03.14; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: A bug was found within the IPv6Test closure
  function (used for calculating IPv6 CIDRs), caused by some excess spaces in
  the code that existed where they shouldn't have existed; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 0.1.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2016.03.03-2016.03.06; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translations for
  the CIDRAM README documentation (written originally in English) into Spanish,
  French, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch (none of these translations
  have been checked/audited by a native/fluent speaker yet, but they should be
  at least accurate enough to be understood). This totals 7 different language
  versions of the README documentation now available.

- [2016.03.07; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Converted all functions to
  closures (anonymous functions), in order to be able to unset them from memory
  after the script execution has finished (we shouldn't leave unrequired data
  in the memory afer execution has finished). Changed the blocksize for reading
  files with the "ReadFile" function from 48KB to 128KB (we can afford this,
  and this should *slightly* increase the speed of the script).

=== Version/Release 0.1.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE (FIRST BETA).

- [2015.12.12; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Added a changelog; Added READMEs.
