# Ignores file.


# ---
# If you want CIDRAM to completely ignore some specific sections within any of the signature files, you can use the
# "ignore.dat" file to specify which sections to ignore. On a new line, write "Ignore", followed by a space, followed
# by the name of the section that you want CIDRAM to ignore. Everything else is considered a comment and will have no
# affect on CIDRAM, and everything here by default (including this message) can be safely erased from the file.

# The list below is included here as an example; The sections listed here are the names of some arbitrarily chosen
# sections from the default CIDRAM signature files, listed here to demonstrate what an ignore list could look like.
# These examples are commmented out at this time in order to deactive them (because they're intended only as an
# example).
