; Attempt to verify requests from search engines? Verifying search engines

; engines can be blocked as per normal, but won't be banned. When not verified,
; it's possible for them to be banned as a result of exceeding the infraction
; limit. Additionally, search engine verification provides protection against
; fake search engine requests and against potentially malicious entities
