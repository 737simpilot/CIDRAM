*__NOTE:__ "IPTestScript" is a temporary working name for this project to be used during the initial alpha stage of development. This name -WILL- be changed to something else, as soon as a more permanent name can be determined. The address to this repository, too, will change, in order to comply with the newer, more permanent name, as soon as that more permanent name is determined. This project is currently in the alpha stage of development, and thus, should only be used by those willing to accept rapid changes to the code, those willing to accept that the script is neither perfect nor complete and those willing to accept that I absolutely can't guarantee that it'll work as intended at this time presently. Reporting any bugs or issues that you may encounter is strongly encouraged. More information will be provided at a later date, but for now, I'm placing higher priority on functionality than anything else.*

*I intend to release this under the GNU/GPLv2 license, so, legally, you may copy, use, adapt, etc, this, as per outlined by that license. However, I'd recommemd holding off doing so until I've developed it a bit further.*

## **What is IPTestScript?**

A PHP script intended to block requests to PHP pages based upon (at this time) IP addresses (and likely other factors, too, in the near future); IP addresses associated with undesirable traffic (and based upon configuration stipulations) will be blocked (and optionally, logged to a logfile).
